TDE-BMG  – Day 1

Keynote by Jatin Sawhney
Venue: Tattva Hills

1. Opening & Context
Day 1 of the Business Review began with high enthusiasm as the team arrived at Tattva Hills around 2 PM after an energetic morning journey. The positive momentum continued over lunch, setting the stage for an impactful and thought-provoking keynote session by Jatin Sir.
He opened the session with a bold and powerful vision:
“1000 Cr – Think Big!”
This set the tone for the entire day — pushing everyone to move beyond incremental thinking and embrace transformational growth.

The core theme of the session was long-term thinking over short-term gains.
Key reflections included:
Once a customer, always a customer – Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) must be the focus.


Customer engagement should be need-led, not product-led.


“Stay in the flow” – consistency in effort builds momentum.


Success is not about size, but about commitment and discipline.


“Prove yourself to yourself.”


A reminder inspired by Shah Rukh Khan’s quote:
 “Gyaan tab hai jab paisa ho” — knowledge must convert into financial outcomes.


The session emphasized that social media may show everyone as successful, but real success is measurable in EBITDA, MRR, and sustainable growth.


Clear financial expectations were outlined:
2 Cr EBITDA – MRR NOW


Build towards a 10 Cr run rate — with clarity on When? and How?


Reverse planning:


Define the 2 Cr target


Talk backwards to determine monthly run rate


Plan for the next 3 years, while reviewing previous plans to refine execution.

Converting strategy into measurable outcomes
